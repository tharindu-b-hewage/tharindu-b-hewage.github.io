                My Ph.D. is focused on re-shaping cloud datacenters for sustainable cloud computing. I am advised by 
                <a href="http://www.buyya.com"> Prof. Rajkumar Buyya </a>, <a href="http://shashikantilager.com"> Dr. Shashikant Ilager</a>
                , and <a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/776966-maria-read"> Dr. Maria A. Rodriguez </a>. I take a software 
                perspective, designing novel scheduling algorithms, as well as power delivery architectures. I evaluate
                systems via practical implementations, as well as simulations at scale. I also conduct teaching at Melbourne
                University as a teaching assistant, leading tutorial classes, marking, and assignment evaluations. I
                was also a part of the evaluation committee for <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc23/call-for-artifacts">
                USENIX Annual Technical Conference</a>. I contribute to open-source with the research findings in my 
                <a href="https://github.com/orgs/crunchycookie/repositories">GitHub</a>. Please refer to the <a href="hewage.io/publications">publication
                </a> section to read more about my research.

                I was promoted to the Senior Software Engineer role. In addition to the R&D role, I lead subteams within 
                the product team, organized and lead a community call, and conducted customer trainings. I also got the 
                opportunity to represent the company as the senior engineer with CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management)
                domain knowledge, in one of the largest integration project the company conducted at that time, for a 
                signature-brand in the USA hospitality industry. Feel free to have a look at

                my wonderful past team-leads took time to write.

                I was a Software Engineer at <a href="https://wso2.com/about/">WSO2</a>, a multinational middleware 
                company with headquarters in Mountain View, California, USA. I was an engineer of the research and 
                development team, for the open-source Identity and Access Management product, 
                <a href="https://github.com/wso2/product-is">WSO2 Identity Server</a>. This is where 
                I gained experiences in running production systems for enterprise, contributing to open-source code-bases,
                providing enterprise customer support on the product, and on-site enterprise deployments.

                Software Engineering Intern as a part of my Bachelor's degree. I developed a 
                <a href="https://github.com/tharindu-b-hewage/deep-video-detection-pizza">C++ system to process
                a satellite television stream, which infers a deep-learning image classification model in real-time

                Bachelor of Science of Engineering (Hons.), specializing in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, 
                graduated with a First Class. I learnt computing stack at the bottom layer in Computer Architecture, with strong 
                focus on electronic circuits. One fun project was we designed and implemented a custom processor on an FPGA
                which could perform image manipulation. Later in the degree I focused on Machine Vision applications, and
                developed <a href="https://github.com/tharindu-b-hewage/deep-video-activity-recognition">a deep learning-based 
                (a 3d Convolution model) video action recognition system </a> to realize an 
                automated shopping store. I worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hmalgewatta/">Hasitha (Ph.D. at Stony Brook University, NY)</a>,

                Completed high school in physical sciences (Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry) in Sri Lanka. This is 
                where I started loving logical reasoning, and mathematics (because in maths, everything can be explained
                with a reason!). I was quite good at it, eventually obtaining distinctions for all subjects and being 
                placed within the top 0.16% (out of 24,000 participants) in Sri Lanka. For this performance, I was awarded
                the Mahapola Merit Scholarship, which supported myself during the bachelors.
