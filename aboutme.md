Hi I'm Tharindu! `Tharindu` means `Moon` in Sinhalese! I am from the beautiful island nation of Sri Lanka, and sinhalese 
is one of the languages it speaks. Let's have a look at where Sri Lanka is. It's a teardrop shaped island right below 
India.

To me, Sri Lanka is a well-blended smoothie of Sun üîÜ, Delicious spicy food üçõ, and Sandy beaches üèñÔ∏è. 
I grew up in a coastal town, called Matara, at the south of Sri Lanka. We had many beaches, but my favorite is `Hiriketiya`
beach. Here is a snap of it. Yes, those are surfers!

My favorite food from Sri Lanka is a Street Food called 'Kottu'. It's a mix of shredded roti, meat, vegetables, and eggs.
Kottu is much popular these days. If you happen to go Sri Lanka, try a restaurant called 
<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eT16fzaV6cqYefbg7">'Grand pila hotel de pilawoos'</a>, and order a cheese masala kottu!
</p>

Back at home, I used to hike a lot. In the middle of the island, we have rainforests, and hidden waterfalls. It was 
quite the adventure to hike through the jungle for about a day, finally to encounter the waterfall and stay the night
by the waterfall. Here is a snap of one of our camps.

And often we come across untouched natural beauties. Here is a snap of a candidate for a perfect infinity pool.

I love music! I can play the guitar a bit (a few chords :D), and love to sing along with my wife, friends and family. 
I have owned two Yamaha guitars, F 310A and FX 370C. These days, I am practicing Piano for leisure with my wonderful piano
teacher. So far I can play Autumn Breeze by Jacob quite well.
</p>
<p class="story">
Apart from that, I love to travel around the world and gain different experiences. Here are a few snaps.

This is me sky-diving in dubai, flying above the Palm Jumeirah. I was fortunate on that day, because right before the 
dive a decent sized cloud was floating below us, and we dived straight through it. That was awesome! You can see that
cloud in the snap below.

During the same visit, me and my friends went to visit sand dunes and had a great time in the desert!

Sri Lanka is famous for scuba diving too! This is me during my first ever dive in Unawatuna, south of Sri Lanka. 
Unfortunately, the water was cloudy that day, so the visibility was less. Nevertheless it was fun! We visited a 
sunken ship near the coast.

I once visited Austria during summer. I have to say, it was such a beautiful country. I loved my short stay there. Here
is myself in Salzburg, Austria!

Here is me with my friends from the university.
