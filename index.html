<p style="text-align: justify;">
I'm a computer science Ph.D. student at University of Melbourne, working in the <a href="http://clouds.cis.unimelb.edu.au/team.html">Cloud Computing and
    Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Laboratory</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.buyya.com"> Prof. Rajkumar Buyya </a>, <a href="http://shashikantilager.com"> Dr. Shashikant Ilager</a>
(Vienna University Of Technology),
    and <a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/776966-maria-read"> Dr. Maria A. Rodriguez </a>. My research interests are focused on reshaping <strong>cloud datacenters for sustainable
    computing</strong> at <strong>cloud orchestration and host operating systems</strong>. I am a recipient of the <a href="https://scholarships.unimelb.edu.au/awards/graduate-research-scholarships">Melbourne
    Graduate Research Scholarship</a>, a two-times winner of outstanding contribution award at <a href="https://wso2.com">WSO2</a>, a first-class honours graduate, and a top 0.16% student (out of 24K) of Physical Sciences in Sri Lanka.

I am an engineer turned into a researcher. As an undergrad<sup>1</sup>, I built my foundations on Computer Architecture<sup>2</sup>,
    Computer Networks, and Machine Vision. As an engineer<sup>3</sup>, I gained 3.5 years of industry experience, in
    designing, implementing, maintaining, and deploying and supporting enterprise solutions, as a member of an open-source
    middleware software product development team. I also have a blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@tharindu-b-hewage">Medium</a>.
</p>

Apart from work, I have a never ending love for Music ðŸŽ¸, Travel &#128745;, and Food ðŸŒ®.

    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-cog fa-spin" style="--fa-animation-duration: 7s;"></i> In industry, I helped running <a href="https://github.com/wso2/product-is/commits?author=tharindu-b-hewage">production systems for enterprise</a></li>
    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-hammer fa-bounce" style="--fa-animation-duration: 3s;"></i> As a researcher, I develop practical systems. For example, <a href="https://github.com/crunchycookie/openstack-gc">have a look at this extension of Openstack for Carbon-aware real-time computing</a></li>
    <li><i class="fa-brands fa-readme fa-flip" style="--fa-animation-duration: 3s;"></i> I love to learn! These days, my focus is Operating Systems. After learning Golang from scratch and a bit about Linux kernel (with the help of Intel's Opensource contributions, of course!), <a href="https://github.com/crunchycookie/core-power-mgt">I was able to control power features of CPU cores!</a></li>
